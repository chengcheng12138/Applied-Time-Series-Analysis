#take diff
#We can take differences of a time series as well. 
#This is equivalent to taking the difference between 
#each value and its previous value:
diff1<-diff(gun,lag = 1)
tm1<-cbind(gun,diff1)
head(tm1)
plot.ts(tm1,
        main="Figure 3.1 take differences transformed GUN")

tm2<-cbind(deaths,diff2)
head(tm2)
plot.ts(tm2,main="Figure 3.2 take differences transformed deaths")
#Often in time series analysis and modeling, we will want to transform data. There are a number of different functions that can be used to 
#transform time series data 
#such as the difference, log, moving average, percent change, lag, or cumulative sum. 
#These type of function are useful for both visualizing time series data and for modeling time series. 
#For example, the moving average function can be used to more easily visualize a high-variance time series and is also a critical part the ARIMA family of models. 
#Functions such as the difference, percent change, and log difference are helpful for 
#making non-stationary data stationary.

#As you can see, taking a difference is an effective way to 
#remove a trend and make a time series stationary.


#Fit an ARIMA model for each one of the series. 
#Use a model selection criterion to select the best models.

# if we use arima modle, we neef to use data or diff data
